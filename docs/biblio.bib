  abstract = {We develop and test spatial population dynamics models that estimate age-dependent offshore movement of fish populations from spatial fishery data. Spatially aggregated population dynamics models produced biased estimates of maximum sustainable yield (MSY) reference points when spatial dynamics were simulated. Spatial population dynamics models provided relatively unbiased estimates of MSY reference points regardless of whether spatial dynamics were simulated. We demonstrate that by using conventional fishery data that are disaggregated spatially, it is possible to estimate movement with age and obtain more accurate estimates of management reference points. The new spatial models were fitted to data for Gulf of Mexico red grouper (Epinephelus morio) and gag grouper (Mycteroperca microlepis) to estimate spatial distribution and offshore movement with age. Offshore ontogeny was estimated to be stronger for gag grouper than red grouper and predicted a larger fraction of older gag grouper in deeper waters.},

  abstract = {Mapping the spatial distributions of fish populations is an integral component of ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM). Particularly for red grouper (Epinephelus morio) and gag grouper (“gag”; Mycteroperca microlepis), two economically important species, the lack of mapping due to data limitations (i.e., inconsistent capture in research surveys) has left a critical gap in the science needed to assess how ecosystem processes and EBFM measures in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) impact their population dynamics. We combined multiple fisheries-dependent and fisheries-independent data sources to map the long-term spatial distributions of older juveniles and adults of red and gag groupers in the U.S. GOM, using spatio-temporal binomial generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). Spatio-temporal binomial GLMMs rely on the idea that probability of encounter at a given site is more similar to probability of encounter at nearby sites than to probability of encounter at geographically remote locations; this tenet allows one to estimate a smoothed surface depicting how probability of encounter varies spatially. Our spatio-temporal binomial GLMMs do not integrate environmental covariates, yet they account for the effects of year and research survey. The distribution maps produced from the predictions of the spatio-temporal binomial GLMMs aligned with the current understanding of the long-term ontogenetic spatial distributions of red and gag groupers in the U.S. GOM. Red grouper was predicted to be encountered throughout the West Florida Shelf (WFS), primarily at depths ranging from 20 to 60m. Both older juvenile and adult female gags were predicted to be encountered from Apalachicola, Florida, to the region northwest of Tampa, Florida, along the 20m depth contour, especially in Apalachee Bay. The probability of encounter of adult female gag was also high in the Florida Middle Grounds and in deeper ({$>$}40m) areas of the WFS. The probability of encounter of adult male gag was highest along the edge of the WFS, both inside recognized spawning grounds (including the Madison-Swanson marine protected area) and outside, i.e., below 27°N (including Pulley Ridge). The distribution maps produced are valuable for understanding the ecology of grouper species and can be used as a basis for further analyses. Our spatio-temporal binomial GLMM framework will serve many important EBFM projects, including the construction of reliable distribution maps in bulk for spatially explicit ecosystem models of the GOM, which will improve spatial distributions and species spatial overlaps in spatially explicit ecosystem models and, therefore, the trophic interactions predicted by these models.},

  abstract = {For the economically and ecologically important Red Snapper Lutjanus campechanus, depth distribution patterns across ontogeny are not well understood, particularly in the southeastern U.S. Atlantic Ocean (SEUSA). Using data derived from two fishery-independent surveys targeting hardbottom habitats, we examined patterns of age- and length-specific depth distributions of postjuvenile (age 1+) Red Snapper in the SEUSA. We also compared age and length distributions between fishery-independent surveys and commercial hook-and-line catches to make inferences about gear-specific age and size selectivity, which could have implications for gear-specific interpretations of Red Snapper depth distribution patterns and for determining selectivity functions used in stock assessments. Older, larger Red Snapper were generally distributed throughout all depths, whereas the younger and smaller Red Snapper occurred disproportionately in relatively shallow waters. For Red Snapper equal to or larger than 50~cm FL, we found no evidence of a positive relationship between depth and age or length. Additionally, age and length distributions of Red Snapper ≥ 50~cm FL did not differ between fishery-independent surveys and the commercial hook-and-line fishery. These results provide no support for assertions of greater abundances of older and larger Red Snapper in deeper SEUSA waters. As observed in this study for Red Snapper in SEUSA waters, we suggest that patterns of increasing age and size with depth for multiple reef-associated fish species in SEUSA and Gulf of Mexico waters may be driven by younger and smaller fish occurring in shallower waters, and older and larger fish being distributed more equally across depths. Analyses to test this hypothesis for multiple species would be informative for their assessment and management and are recommended. Received October 21, 2013; accepted March 11, 2014},

  abstract = {Residence time, site fidelity and movements for red snapper Lutjanus campechanus (Lutjanidae) were estimated from long-term telemetry monitoring (December 2005 to June 2010) at 6 sites (1 natural and 5 artificial reefs) in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. Each site consisted of an array of 5 receivers, with 1 at the center reef site and 4 receivers placed 1100 m north, south, east and west of center (2 km radius detection area). Throughout the study, a stationary control transmitter was located 400 m south of the center receiver at each site to estimate changes in detection rates from environmental factors. These receiver arrays enabled fishery independent estimations of fishing mortality, natural mortality and emigration. Event analysis was used to estimate site fidelity and residence, based on right-censoring fishing and natural mortality. Median residence time was 542 d, ranging from 1 to 1099 d, with 72\% of fish staying at least 1 yr at the site. Some fish (n = 12) showed seasonal and directed movements to other sites (up to 8 km away) and returned to original sites up to 7 mo later. Diel movements away from the structure tended to occur at night. Site fidelity and residence times of red snapper in the present study were greater than in any previous study and show the importance of artificial reefs for this species.},
