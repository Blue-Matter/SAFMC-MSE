# from Gag TPL

N_mdyr(styr)(1,nages)=elem_prod(N(styr)(1,nages),(mfexp(-1.*(Z_initial(1,nages))*0.5))); //mid year
N_spawn(styr)(1,nages)=elem_prod(N(styr)(1,nages),(mfexp(-1.*(Z_initial(1,nages))*spawn_time_frac))); //peak spawning time

# Z_initial is F at start of first year, but doesn't include F during that year
