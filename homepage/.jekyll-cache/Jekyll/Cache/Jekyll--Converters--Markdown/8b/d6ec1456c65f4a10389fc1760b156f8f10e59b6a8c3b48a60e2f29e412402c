I",<p>The Snapper-Grouper Complex is a diverse group of fishes managed by the <a href="https://safmc.net/">South Atlantic Fishery Management Council</a>. They  are targeted by recreational and commercial fishermen throughout the South Atlantic region (Virginia
and North Carolina border through the Florida Keys).</p>

<p>Several species in the region managed by the Council are overfished and experiencing overfishing based on the findings of recent age-based
stock assessments. The Council has responded to the findings of these stock assessments by
revising the sustainable catch levels for each species. Due to the significant reductions needed to
constrain catch for multiple stocks, the Council is considering a holistic approach to manage the
multi-species fishery that will address overfishing and rebuild depleted stocks through an
evaluation of different management approaches.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bluematterscience.com/">Blue Matter Science</a> has been contracted to work with the Council to develop a <a href="https://harveststrategies.org/management-strategy-evaluation-2/">Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE)</a> to describe potential outcomes of different management approaches
for the Snapper-Grouper Fishery.</p>

<p>The MSE will consider the biological, economic, and social
impacts of different management approaches. The <a href="https://openmse.com/">openMSE</a> framework will be used to develop and condition operating models based on the available fishery data, design customized management procedures for the Snapper-Grouper fishery, and evaluate the performance of these management procedures using closed-loop simulation testing. Performance metrics recommended by the public and the Council will be used to evaluate the relative performance of the management approaches to achieving objectives.</p>
