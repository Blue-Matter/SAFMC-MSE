## OM_02: Lower M

The natural mortality rate (*M*) is reduced from the Base Case value to the lower value considered in the assessment sensitivity tests.

**Red Snapper**

*M* for mature adults is reduced from 0.107 (Base Case) to 0.07.

**Gag**

*M* for mature adults is reduced from 0.172 (Base Case) to 0.10.

## OM_03: Higher M

The natural mortality rate (*M*) is increased from the Base Case value to the higher value considered in the assessment sensitivity tests.

**Red Snapper**

*M* for mature adults is increased from 0.107 (Base Case) to 0.15

**Gag**

*M* for mature adults is reduced from 0.172 (Base Case) to 0.25.


## OM_04: Reduced Rec Landings

The Landings and Discards from the General Recreational Fleet are reduced by 40% from the reported values used in the Base Case OM. The reduction is applied to all historical years.

## OM_05: Increased PE

Productivity changes in the projection years through an increase in recruitment variability. 

The historical fishery reconstruction is the same as the Base Case OM, but the variability in recruitment is increased in the projection years by a factor of 1.5.

## OM_06: Increased Rec Effort

The historical fishery reconstruction is the same as the Base Case OM, but in the projection years the fishing effort from the General Recreational fleet is assumed to increase by 2% each year.

## OM_07: Lower FL Biomass

Spatial Alternative OM not developed yet. Will be finalized once spatial management strategies are determined.

## OM_08: Higher FL Biomass

Spatial Alternative OM not developed yet. Will be finalized once spatial management strategies are determined.
